# Roop Verma Archive - Back End

Its purpose of this project is to make the life work of late sitarist Acharya Roop Verma accessible to the many around the world who loved him, and wish to stay connected to him.

This is currently in early stages of production, and exists as a simple audio player that pulls tracks from this node.js server, which uses MySQL for the database and serving just a handful of tracks through Cloudinary. The repo for the front end can be found <a href="https://github.com/tomekregulski/roop-verma-archive-client">here</a>.

There are decades' worth of concerts, classes, lectures, and miedtations. The current focus is on the concert recordings, and the rest will come over time.

In addition to audio, the project will eventually be expanded to incude other forms of media - including video, images, writings
